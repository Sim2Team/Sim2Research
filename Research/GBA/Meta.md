## Some notes

The only things i know so far are:

* It doesn't seem to have a Checksum in place.
* It seems to be related to the last played slot data. This is completely unresearched as i haven't gotten into yet.
* The section seems to start at `0x19` up to `0xFFF` or something like that.
* I'm not even sure what that section is... so i just call it "Meta" for now, lol.
