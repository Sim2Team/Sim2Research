# Sim2Research
Some research from me about The Sims 2 for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance and the Nintendo DS.

## Structures

The Structures directory contains research structures in C++ format. If you want to learn more about that, read the `.md` file for that inside the `Research` directory.


## Research

The Research directory contains some more research informations about the specific things. This may also contain some C++ examples for example how to calculate some things or utilities. If you're more interested into the Structure, take a look at the `.cpp` file for that inside the `Structures` directory.


## Tests

Some tests for each research i've done. Maybe you are interested to look into it as well or not.

## Tools

Some tools that i wrote while in the research.
